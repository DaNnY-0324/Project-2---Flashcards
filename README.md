## Project Overview

**Time spent:** 15 hours in total

This project is a fully responsive React web application designed to simulate an interactive flashcard system, where users can engage in different study modes (Quiz, Flashcard, Test) while keeping track of their progress with animations and custom visual feedback.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality has been implemented:

- [x] The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards, are displayed.
- [x] A single card at a time is displayed, showing only one component of the card's information pair.
- [x] A list of card pairs is created.
- [x] Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair.
- [x] Clicking the next button displays a random new card.

## Optional Features

In addition to the required features, the following **optional** features have been implemented:

- [x] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text.
- [x] Cards have different visual styles based on their category:
  - Green for a correct answer.
  - Red for an incorrect answer.

---

## New Features

Here are additional features and enhancements implemented in the app:

- **Test Mode**: Users input answers manually. The card only flips upon submitting the correct answer. Incorrect answers show a red card with the message "Incorrect, try again" before flipping back to the question.
- **Quiz Mode Enhancements**: Cards only flip when an answer is selected. Incorrect answers flip the card to a red state and then flip back to the question automatically.
- **Shuffle Functionality**: A shuffle button randomizes the order of the flashcards.
- **Streak Counter**: Tracks the user's current and longest streak of correct answers. The streak resets when an incorrect answer is given.

## Additional Features

- [x] **Theme Switcher**: A slider toggles between light and dark modes using emojis (ðŸŒž / ðŸŒœ).
- [x] **Animations**: Added smooth animations for flipping cards in all modes (Quiz, Flashcard, and Test).
- [x] **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices.

## Challenges

Some challenges I encountered while working on this project:

- **Managing state across multiple modes**: Transitioning smoothly between Quiz, Flashcard, and Test modes required careful state management.
- **Card flipping animation**: Ensuring that the card flips at the correct time based on user input in different modes was tricky.
- **Implementing the streak counter**: Accurately tracking the user's current and longest streak of correct answers and resetting the counter on incorrect answers.
- **Shuffle Functionality**: Making sure the shuffle function randomized the cards without disrupting the userâ€™s progress or the app's state.
