# Web Development Project 2 - _React Flashcards and Quiz App_

Submitted by: **Danny Nguyen**

This web app: **A React-based Flashcard and Quiz application with multiple modes: Quiz mode (answering multiple-choice questions with feedback), Flashcard mode (flipping cards to reveal answers), and Test mode (input answers manually). The app includes shuffle functionality, a streak counter, animations, theme switching, and responsive design.**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards are displayed**
- [x] **A single card at a time is displayed, only showing one of the components of the information pair**
- [x] **A list of card pairs is created**
- [x] **Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair**
- [x] **Clicking the next button displays a random new card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Cards contain images in addition to or in place of text
- [x] Cards have different visual styles, such as color based on their category
  - [x] _Green for correct answer, Red for incorrect answer_

## New Features

- [x] **Test Mode**: Users input their answers manually, and the card only flips upon submitting the correct answer. Incorrect answers show a red card with the message "Incorrect, try again" before flipping back to the question.
- [x] **Quiz Mode Enhancements**: Cards only flip when an answer is selected. Incorrect answers flip the card to a red state and flip back to the question automatically.
- [x] **Shuffle Functionality**: A shuffle button randomizes the order of the flashcards.
- [x] **Streak Counter**: Tracks the user's current and longest streak of correct answers. The streak resets when an incorrect answer is given.

## Additional Features

- [x] **Theme switcher slider that toggles between light and dark modes using emojis (ðŸŒž / ðŸŒœ)**
- [x] **Animations added for flipping cards in all modes (Quiz, Flashcard, and Test)**
- [x] **Responsive design for mobile devices**

## Notes

### Challenges

- **Managing state for multiple modes**: Implementing smooth transitions between Quiz, Flashcard, and Test modes required careful state management.
- **Card flipping animation**: Ensuring the card flips at the right time based on user input for different modes was a challenge.
- **Implementing streak counter**: Accurately tracking the user's current and longest streak of correct answers while resetting the counter on incorrect answers.
- **Shuffle Functionality**: Ensuring the shuffle function randomized the flashcards without disrupting the app's state and user flow.
